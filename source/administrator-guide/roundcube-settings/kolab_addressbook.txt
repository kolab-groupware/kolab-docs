``kolab_addressbook_prio``
==========================

This option allows to set addressbooks priority or to disable some of them. Disabled addressbooks will be not shown in the UI. Default: ``0``.
Possible values:
``0`` - "Global address book(s) first". Use all address books, starting with the global (LDAP)
``1`` - "Personal address book(s) first". Use all address books, starting with the personal (Kolab)
``2`` - "Global address book(s) only". Use the global (LDAP) addressbook. Disable the personal.
``3`` - "Personal address book(s) only". Use the personal (Kolab) addressbook(s). Disable the global.

``kolab_addressbook_carddav_url``
=================================

Base URL to build fully qualified URIs to access address books via CardDAV. By default not set.
The following replacement variables are supported:
``%h`` - Current HTTP host
``%u`` - Current webmail user name
``%n`` - Folder name
``%i`` - Folder UUID
Example: ``$config['kolab_addressbook_carddav_url'] = 'http://%h/iRony/addressbooks/%u/%i';``.

``kolab_addressbook_carddav_ldap``
==================================

Name of LDAP addressbook (a key in ``ldap_public`` configuration array) for which the CardDAV URI will be displayed if ``kolab_addressbook_carddav_url`` is set.
Use it when iRony's ``kolabdav_ldap_directory`` is enabled. Note that ``kolab_addressbook_carddav_url`` must use ``%i`` and not ``%n``.

    .. WARNING::
        There are limitations with volume and performance:
        - CardDAV does a full sync of the entire contact resource. For LDAP this means that all entries matching the base_dn/filter are synced to every client.
            It's thus only recommended for small setups with a couple hundred LDAP entries.
        - Other than that, the ldap-directory exposed in iRony is strictly read-only.
            Although correctly stated in the CardDAV properties, some clients (e.g. the Thunderbird SoGO connector) ignore these properties and allow modifications which then result in sync errors because the server denies such updates.
