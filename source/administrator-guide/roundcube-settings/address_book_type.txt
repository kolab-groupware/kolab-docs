``address_book_type``
=====================

This indicates which type of address book to use. Possible choises:
'sql' (default), 'ldap' and ''.

If set to 'ldap' then it will look at using the first writable LDAP
address book as the primary address book and it will not display the
SQL address book in the 'Address Book' view.
If set to '' then no address book will be displayed or only the
addressbook which is created by a plugin (like CardDAV).
