``use_https``
=============

Tell PHP that it should work as under secure connection even if it doesn't recognize it as secure ($_SERVER['HTTPS'] is not set).
e.g. when you're running Roundcube behind a https proxy.
This option is mutually exclusive to 'force_https' and only either one of them should be set to true.
