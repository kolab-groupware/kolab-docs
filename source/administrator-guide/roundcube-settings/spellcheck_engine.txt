``spellcheck_engine``
=====================

Set the spell checking engine. Possible values:

- 'googie'  - the default (also used for connecting to Nox Spell Server, see 'spellcheck_uri' setting)
- 'pspell'  - requires the PHP Pspell module and aspell installed
- 'enchant' - requires the PHP Enchant module
- 'atd'     - install your own After the Deadline server or check with the people at http://www.afterthedeadline.com before using their API

Since Google shut down their public spell checking service, the default settings connect to http://spell.roundcube.net which is a hosted service provided by Roundcube. You can connect to any other googie-compliant service by setting 'spellcheck_uri' accordingly.
