``mime_types``
==============

Absolute path to a local mime.types mapping table file.
This is used to derive mime-types from the filename extension or vice versa.
Such a file is usually part of the apache webserver. If you don't find a file named mime.types on your system, download it from http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types
