.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public:

``ldap_public``
===============

A list of so-called Global Address Books, or Global Address Lists,
useful for auto-completion of addresses being typed in to the To, CC and
BCC fields when composing an email, when using the ACL plugin, and for
searches from mobile devices and desktop clients using ActiveSync
(through Syncroton) and/or CardDAV (through iRony).

The first item configured here is the identifier of the address book.
That being said, an example would look as follows:

.. code-block:: php

    $config['ldap_public'] = Array(
            'addressbook1' => Array(
                    (... settings for address book #1 omitted ...)
                ),

            'addressbook2' => Array(
                    (... settings for address book #2 omitted ...)
                ),
        );

While it is not very common to have multiple global address books, some
organizations put one address book in the list of address books to use
for auto-completion, and use another address book to store a copy of the
local phone book -- you know, with residents and businesses in the area
-- or address books of partner organizations.

Using the :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_autocomplete_addressbooks`
setting, one address book can be used for auto-completion, while the
other address book is available for searching in the web client, on
mobile devices and using desktop clients using ActiveSync (through
Syncroton) and/or CardDAV (through iRony).

A large amount of settings are available for the global address books.
By default, Kolab Groupware configures the organization's address book
to use a set of configuration options that is designed to provide an
easy growth-path to beyond 1.000 entries.

``name``
--------

The name of the address book as it is presented in Roundcube.

Example:

.. code-block:: php

    $config['ldap_public'] = Array(
            'addressbook1' => Array(
                    'name' => 'Global Address Book',
                ),
        );

.. NOTE::

    The label used here is not available for localization.

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_hosts:

``hosts``
---------

A list of LDAP server addresses to use to connect to.

Magic configuration values are available:

``%h``

    The user's IMAP hostname.

``%n``

    The value of ``$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']``.

    .. WARNING::

        The ``$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']`` value is not the same as the
        ``$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`` value.

        ``$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']`` is a server-side configuration
        item, ``$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`` is an item specified by the
        client.

``%t``

    The value of ``$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']`` but without the hostname --
    ergo, this is the domain name space that ``$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']``
    resides in.

    For a webserver virtualhost named ``webmail.example.org``, ``%t`` is
    ``example.org``.

    For a webserver virtualhost named ``webmail.someone.somewhere.tld``,
    ``%t`` is ``someone.somewhere.tld``.

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_port:

``port``
--------

The port to use to connect to LDAP.

.. NOTE::

    Note that the port number specified here is used for all server
    addresses configured in
    :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_hosts`.

``use_tls``
-----------

Whether or not to encrypt the connection. Useful with
:ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_port` set to 389 (explicit
SSL through STARTTLS), not so much with the port set to 636 (implicit
SSL).

``ldap_version``
----------------

The LDAP protocol version to use. Set this to 3 or be prepared to be
(unpleasantly) surprised.

``network_timeout``
-------------------

The timeout.

``user_specific``
-----------------

Whether or not to bind to LDAP with the user's credentials, as opposed
to global credentials, allowing for organizations to hide or show parts
of the Directory Information Tree hierarchy, and/or hide or show certain
attributes of certain entries.

Set this to ``true`` -- the default in Kolab Groupware -- and configure
:ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_search_base_dn` and
:ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_search_filter`, and if
anonymous binding is not allowed -- the default in Kolab Groupware -- or
anonymous searches are not allowed -- the default in Kolab Groupware --
also configure
:ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_search_bind_dn` and
:ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_search_bind_pw`.

.. NOTE::

    There is no setting for the search scope.

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_base_dn:

``base_dn``
-----------

The base DN to use for searching entries to be presented in the global
address book, such as ``ou=Employees,ou=People,dc=example,dc=org``.

See :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_group_filters` for more
examples on what else this allows you to do.

``bind_dn``
-----------

The bind dn to use for displaying the address book. Kolab Groupware sets
this to ``%dn`` by default, to have the connection be bound with the
user's credentials.

``bind_pass``
-------------

The password, which when ``bind_dn`` is set to ``%dn`` (the default),
better be ``%p``.

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_config_root_dn:

``config_root_dn``
------------------

Use ``config_root_dn`` to search for VLV and SSS settings.

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_domain_base_dn:

``domain_base_dn``
------------------

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_domain_filter:

``domain_filter``
-----------------

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_domain_name_attr:

``domain_name_attr``
--------------------

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_domain_result_attr:

``domain_result_attr``
----------------------

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_search_base_dn:

``search_base_dn``
------------------

When searching for object entries that match the logged in user, start
searching at this base DN.

Useful when you want to limit who can use the address book with their
own credentials, versus 'anonymously', and/or when attribute values
searched for are not globally unique.

One could set ``base_dn`` to ``ou=People,dc=example,dc=org``, while
setting ``search_base_dn`` to
``ou=Management,ou=Employees,ou=People,dc=example,dc=org``.

One could then set an ACL on
``ou=Employees,ou=People,dc=example,dc=org``,
that does not permit the credentials configured in ``search_dn_default``
to read certain attributes of entries, such as ``street``, ``mobile``,
and other such information that might be personal in nature.

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_search_filter:

``search_filter``
-----------------

When searching for object entries that match the logged in user, use the
search filter configured with this setting.

Magic configuration values are available:

``%fu``

    The full username, usually also the user's primary email address,
    though possibly of the form ``<username>@<imaphostname>``.

    The full extent of possibilities (which depend on configuration
    and plugins interacting with the authentication process) is beyond
    the scope of this document, so suffice it to say that
    :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings-plugin_kolab_auth` applies a process
    called :term:`canonification` that makes ``%fu`` be substituted by
    the fully qualified primary recipient email address of the Kolab
    user.

    In Kolab Groupware, by default, the attribute value of ``mail`` is
    used.

    This is also the user's mailbox name (``user/<mail>`` or
    ``user/john.doe@example.org`` for user ``john.doe@example.org``) and
    is globally unique.

    Example: ``(&(objectclass=kolabinetorgperson)(mail=%fu))``.

``%u``

    The username local part, or "everything before the '@'".

    In ``john.doe@example.org``, this would become ``john.doe``.

    To allow users to log in with their ``uid`` attribute value, one
    could specify ``(&(objectclass=kolabinetorgperson)(uid=%u))``.

``%d``

    The domain name space of the username, or "everything after the
    '@'".

    In ``john.doe@example.org``, this would become ``example.org``.

``%dc``

    The root dn that corresponds with the domain name space used to
    login.

    When ``john.doe@example.org`` logs in, the domain name space of
    ``example.org`` would typically correspond with a root dn of
    ``dc=example,dc=org`` -- if ``example.org`` is a
    :term:`parent domain name space` and no
    :term:`domain_result_attribute`
    is available for the ``domainrelatedobject`` entry.

    .. NOTE::

        Using ``%dc`` requires
        :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_domain_base_dn`,
        :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_domain_filter`,
        :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_domain_name_attr`,
        and
        :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_domain_result_attr`

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_search_bind_dn:

``search_bind_dn``
------------------

The bind dn to use when searching for object entries that match the user
currently logged in.

This should be a privileged entity that is allowed to search throughout the
tree configured in ``search_base_dn``, but has no privileges other than to
read the relevant attributes of entries.

By default, Kolab Groupware configures this setting to be the same setting
used for Postfix lookup tables, namely
``uid=kolab-service,ou=Special Users,dc=example,dc=org``.

This entry has specific search, time and lookthrough limitations configured,
allowing it to search throughout the entire Directory Information Tree
hierarchy.

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_search_bind_pw:

``search_bind_pw``
------------------

The bind password to use alongside
:ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_search_bind_dn`.

``search_bind_attrib``
----------------------

Undocumented.

``search_dn_default``
---------------------

Undocumented.

``auth_cid``
------------

Not used in Kolab Groupware.

``auth_method``
---------------

Not used in Kolab Groupware.

``hidden``
----------

A boolean, this configuration option allows you to hide this address book from
the address book task view. Default: ``false``.

``searchonly``
--------------

Renders the address book searchable only -- meaning, its contents cannot be
browsed. Default: ``false``.

``writable``
------------

Not used in Kolab Groupware.

``LDAP_Object_Classes``
-----------------------

Not used in Kolab Groupware.

``LDAP_rdn``
------------

Not used in Kolab Groupware.

``required_fields``
-------------------

Not used in Kolab Groupware.

``search_fields``
-----------------

A list of attribute names to search values for, when searching is executed.

Default: ``displayName``, ``mail``.

.. NOTE::

    Only list attribute names for which the appropriate indexes have been
    created. In the context of searching, presence and equality indexes are
    insufficient.

.. NOTE::

    The attribute ``alias`` is not included by default, because the attribute
    does not -- by default -- have an index created on it. See
    :ref:`admin_ldap_controlling_indexes_and_indexing` for information on
    indexes.

``fieldmap``
------------

The fieldmap maps LDAP attribute names to Roundcube placeholder names.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block:: php

    'fieldmap' => Array(
            'name'          => 'displayName',
            'surname'       => 'sn',
            'firstname'     => 'givenName',
            'initials'      => 'initials',
            'jobtitle'      => 'title',
            'email'         => 'mail:*'
            'phone:home'    => 'telephoneNumber',
            'phone:mobile'  => 'mobile',
            'department'    => 'ou',
            (...)
        ),

``sub_fields``
--------------

Undocumented.

``autovalues``
--------------

Undocumented.

``sort``
--------

A list of attribute names to sort entries by.

Kolab Groupware uses a default of ``displayname``, ``sn``, ``givenname``,
``cn``, in that order, which very much corresponds with the default Server-Side
Sorting configuration we recommend you use when your Directory Information Tree
is likely to contain over 1.000 entries.

.. seealso::

    *   Administrator Guide, Tweaking LDAP, :ref:`admin_ldap_configure-sss`
    *   Administrator Guide, Tweaking LDAP, :ref:`admin_ldap_configure-vlv`

``scope``
---------

The :term:`search scope` to use when looking for address book entries, starting
at the :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_base_dn`.

``filter``
----------

The filter to use when searching for entries to display in the address book.

By default, Kolab Groupware sets this to ``(objectclass=inetorgperson)``, so
that not only Kolab users (``(objectclass=kolabinetorgperson)``) are a part of
the address book, but any non-Kolab users in LDAP, and any non-Groupware users
(such as external contacts) are part of the address book too.

.. seealso::

    *   :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_vlv`

``fuzzy_search``
----------------

Undocumented.

.. _admin_roundcube-settings_ldap_public_vlv:

``vlv``
-------

``true`` or ``false`` (default), the ``vlv`` boolean configures Roundcube to use
the server-side Virtual List View control, ideal for sorting, pagination and --
a particular feature of Kolab Groupware's ``Net/LDAP3`` -- responsive, fuzzy
searching capabilities regardless of the size of the Directory Information Tree.

In order to automatically delect available VLV indexes, the option ``config_root_dn``
needs to be set as well.

.. seealso::

    *   Administrator Guide, Tweaking LDAP, :ref:`admin_ldap_configure-sss`
    *   Administrator Guide, Tweaking LDAP, :ref:`admin_ldap_configure-vlv`

``vlv_search``
--------------

DEPRECATED. Use Virtual List View functions for autocompletion searches. This option
is obsolete when ``vlv`` is enabled.

``numsub_filter``
-----------------

With ``vlv`` enabled, we also use numSubOrdinates to query the total number of records.
Set this filter to get all numSubOrdinates attributes for counting.

Only set this option if your php-ldap module doesn't support the ``ldap_parse_virtuallist_control()``
function which is part of an unofficial patch to php-ldap.

``config_root_dn``
------------------

The base DN to be used for searching LDAP configuration sesstings such as VLV indexes.
Set to ``cn=config`` as the default value for standard Kolab setups.

Without this option, no VLV will be used for LDAP queries.

``sizelimit``
