Roundcube Settings Reference Guide
==================================

Roundcube is configured using a default settings file, a settings file
for site-specific configuration, host-specific configuration files, and
configuration files specific to plugins.

The configuration inheritance model looks as follows:

``config/defaults.inc.php``

    This configuration file ships the default settings for Roundcube.

    .. NOTE::

        On the expanded sources (from tarball releases), this file is at
        :file:`your/install/path/config/defaults.inc.php`. On packaged
        distributions however, this path is a symbolic link to
        :file:`/etc/roundcubemail/defaults.inc.php`.

``config/config.inc.php``

    Site-specific global settings are in this configuration file.

    .. NOTE::

        On the expanded sources (from tarball releases), this file
        starts out as
        :file:`your/install/path/config/config.inc.php.dist`.

        You would rename this original ``.dist`` file to
        :file:`your/install/path/config/config.inc.php`, but on packaged
        distributions, this is already done by the packaging. Similar to
        ``defaults.inc.php``, this configuration file also lives in
        :file:`/etc/roundcubemail/`, at
        :file:`/etc/roundcubemail/config.inc.php` to be precise, and a
        symbolic link is created from to original file location to this
        location.

``config/<site>.inc.php``

    ``<site>`` being a placeholder for an arbitrary site name, Roundcube
    allows the inclusion of additional configuration using the
    :ref:`admin_roundcube-settings_include_host_config` setting.

    This is, however, NOT the recommended solution.

``plugins/<plugin_name>/config.inc.php``

    Each plugin that requires configuration ships a
    :file:`config.inc.php.dist`.

    As you may have suspected, these configuration files too are created
    symbolic links for, to
    :file:`/etc/roundcubemail/<plugin_name>.inc.php`.

Since the configuration files are PHP code that is being executed while
the configuration loads, one might add include statements such that
configured condititions load additional configuration files on top of
the aforementioned four (types).

For example, :file:`/etc/roundcubemail/config.inc.php` might have a
segment to establish defaults at the start, then include a site specific
configuration file:

.. code-block:: php

    // Do test whether the file exists before requiring it.
    if (file_exists(dirname(__FILE__) . PATH_SEPARATOR . $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] . PATH_SEPARATOR . basename(__FILE__))) {
        require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . PATH_SEPARATOR . $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] . PATH_SEPARATOR . basename(__FILE__));
    }

and then re-apply mandatory defaults:

.. code-block:: php

    $mandatory_plugins = Array(
            'kolab_auth',           # Applies globally required routines
                                    # including authentication,
                                    # authorization and canonification.

            'kolab_folders',        # Hides groupware folders if the
                                    # plugins for them are not loaded.
        );

    foreach ( $mandatory_plugins as $num => $plugin ) {
        if (!in_array($plugin, $config['plugins'])) {
                $config['plugins'][] = $plugin;
        }
    }
