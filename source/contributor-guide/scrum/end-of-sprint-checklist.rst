=======================
End of Sprint Checklist
=======================

At or near the end of a sprint:

*   The `current sprint`_ must be archived after Friday, 17:00 Europe/Zurich.

*   The `current sprint`_ must have its additional ``sprint_current``
    hashtag removed.

*   Tickets that remain open in the `current sprint`_ must be moved forward
    on to the `next sprint`_.

    .. NOTE::

        The column for these tickets in the `current sprint`_ should be
        reflected in the `next sprint`_, which requires manual intervention.

        Click the downward facing arrow on each of the relevant columns, and
        choose *Batch Edit Tasks...*.

        Associate the project tag for the next sprint.

*   The `next sprint`_ becomes the current sprint, and thus:

    *   Remove the additional hashtag ``sprint_next``,

    *   Add the additional hashtag ``sprint_current``.

*   The sprint after the next sprint needs to be created;

    *   The sprint runs from a Monday 09:00 AM to the following Friday 05:00
        PM.

    *   Ensure the dates selected for the Monday and the Friday are those for
        the week number of the sprint (as opposed to the defaults).

    *   Use an additional hashtag of ``sprint_next``.

*   Verify the (now) `current sprint`_ (but actually next week's) actually has
    sufficient tickets in its backlog, because idling is for jet engines with
    reverse thrusters deployed while in flight.
