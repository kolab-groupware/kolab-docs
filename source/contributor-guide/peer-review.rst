Peer Review
===========

Peer review is a process in which developers submit code changes to a staging
environment, so that other peers have the opportunity to review the work before
the code changes are submitted back to the source code management repository.

In our development platform, this process is facilitated by `Differential`_. To
use `Differential`_, you must install **arcanist** and set it up.

In Kolab development, this stage allows work to progress on writing tests that
fail, first, subsequently supplemented by the work on code changes that make
those tests succeed.

    *   :ref:`contributor-guide-test-driven-development`

The changes submitted are reviewed on Thursday afternoons at the latest.

Your changes need to be reviewed by at least one other person, who is a
software development project member.

In :ref:`contributor-guide-test-driven-development`, the submission of the
differential associated with your review process aides in the staging of the
code changes.
