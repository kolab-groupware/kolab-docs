Contributor Guide
=================

Kolab Groupware development largely follows an iterative and incremental
agile software development metholodogy also known as `Scrum`_.

In summary, the development process is divided into stages, with different
teams participating in getting tasks to the next stage of the process.

Kolab Groupware is a collaboration suite consisting of many components,
each of them separate software development projects, some of them
dependent on third-party software development projects, and some of them
separate altogether.
