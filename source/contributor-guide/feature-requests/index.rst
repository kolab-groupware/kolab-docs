The Definition of a Feature Request
===================================

A feature request is a description of a problem space for which we may seek the
resolution to be provided within, or with the help of, Kolab.

Such a problem space is articulated in and by itself, and allows for
understanding to be formed and interpretation to be fine-tuned over the course
of a process with multiple parties contributing.

.. IMPORTANT::

    Using **problem spaces** re-inforces the importance of the human
    experience for the final product enhancement.

A bad example of a feature request would be:

    *Make the button background red.*

This example neither addresses the actual problem, nor the potential value of a
resolution.

A better example would be:

    *The contrast between the button background and page is too low.*

Any target use-case or workflow described must be considered only as a context
establishing a higher level of comprehension in elaboration, about the
dimensions of the problem space. Per the existing example:

    *Color vision deficiencies do not allow some people to distinguish the
    button from the background.*

This would allow us to clarify whether a high-contrast UI is needed, or a
slight adjustment suffices. We would also get to cover other angles.

Feature requests without a sufficiently accurate or encompassing description of
the problem space to address will not be accepted.

Where Do Feature Requests Go?
=============================

Feature requests can be entered in to the Kolab development platform using
`this form <https://git.kolab.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/12/>`_.

It's submitted to the backlog of the :red:`Architecture & Design` team.

The `Architecture & Design`_ team evaluates the enhancement requests, requests
additional feedback if needed, and assigns the priority should the request be
promoted.

The responsibility of this team is to ensure that, in the inception phase, and
before the elaboration phase;

*   we have an accurate and full problem space description, and

*   we understand the scope and dimensions of the problem space, and

*   we can successfully determine where the problem should be resolved, and

*   we can determine the resolution to this problem space makes sense for the
    product that is Kolab, or

*   we can determine that the problem space is better addressed by existing,
    external tooling, and find a means for that external tooling to be
    integrated with Kolab, or

*   we can determine that addressing the problem space does not enhance the
    Kolab product, and

*   an estimate value of resolving the problem space can be established.

This leads to a common understanding of scope of delivery, the definition of
done, and the way to verify the results.

**Backlog**

All feature enhancement requests put forth. Mostly with wishlist priority.

**Inception**

Would this change the world? How would this change the world?

**Elaboration**

How do we change the world?

**Construction**

The hardhats get to putting the brick and mortar in place.

**Transition**

.. This part of the process is called :ref:`developer-guide-process-inception`.
