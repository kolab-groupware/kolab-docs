Test-Driven Development
=======================

Test-driven development is a process in the
:ref:`contributor-guide-phases-construction`.

The process of development driven by testing can be transcribed as follows:

#.  You get handed a set of clear requirements -- mostly in the form of user
    stories you can verify, and documentation on the design -- architecture and
    mockups.

#.  You write the tests that verify those requirements are implemented.

#.  You write the code that makes the tests succeed.
