First Login
===========

Once you have successfully set up the Kolab Groupware server, it is time to add
some users.

Please see :ref:`howto_kolab-webadmin-create-user` for a step by step guide,
with useful additional information.

The web client is available under the ``/roundcubemail/`` location on your web-
server.

Additional locations for applications installed include:

    *   chwala: ``/chwala/``
    *   iRony:  ``/iRony/``
    *   kolab-freebusy: ``/freebusy/``
    *   kolab-webadmin: ``/kolab-webadmin/``
    *   roundcubemail: ``/roundcubemail/``

Next, perhaps read the :ref:`admin` chapters such as:

    *   :ref:`admin-config`, among which the :ref:`admin_rcpt-policy`,
    *   :ref:`admin-webadmin`,
    *   monitoring, tweaking, securing your Kolab server and more.
