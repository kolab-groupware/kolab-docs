Current Release
===============

The most recent version of Kolab is :orange:`winterfell`. The community is working
to supercede this release by :orange:`Kolab 18` in Q1 2018.

The current recommended version for supported production deployments is
|ReleaseProduction|.

The release of :orange:`Kolab 18` will occur in Q1 of 2018, at which point
|ReleaseProduction| will no longer be supported by the community, and
`Kolab Systems AG`_ takes over long-term support for its customers.

We expect that :orange:`Kolab 18` will be upgraded to "gold" status in Q2 2018,
and become the release for production installations. Subscription-based
support from `Kolab Systems AG`_ will also be available for :orange:`Kolab 18`.

For subscription-based support of Kolab installations, please visit
`Kolab Enterprise <https://kolabenterprise.com/>`_,
which offers services for all sizes of business, government, NGO, and
educational organizations. You can read about the
:ref:`advantages of a Kolab subscription <advantages-of-subscription>`.
