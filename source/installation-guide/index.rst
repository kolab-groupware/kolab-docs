Current Release
===============

The most recent version of Kolab is |ReleaseCurrent|.

This is a preview release appropriate for pilot projects, testing, and development. 
It is not recommended for production deployments at this time. You can help |K16| reach
production readiness by using |ReleaseCurrent|, keeping it up to date, and
`reporting issues <../contributor-guide/bug-reporting-casual.html>`_ you may encounter.

The current recommended version for production deployment is |ReleaseProduction|.

The release of Kolab 16.1 will occur in Q2 of 2016, at which point Kolab 16 will be
upgraded to "gold" status and become the recomended release for production installations.
Subscription-based support from `Kolab Systems AG`_ will also be available for Kolab 16.1.

For subscription-based support of Kolab installations, please visit
