What is Kolab Groupware?
========================

Kolab Groupware is a secure, scalable, reliable, flexible, full-featured
collaboration suite.

Kolab is entirely **Free and Open Source Software** (a.k.a. FOSS), and
uses **Open Standards**. We'll get to why this is important to us, and
hope that it is important to you thereafter.

The Kolab Groupware community has been around for well over a decade,
and is a vibrant mixture of people from all breeds of life -- including
technical, artistic, political, medical, legal, logistical, military and
what-have-you.

Kolab Groupware is the glue between the various pieces of software you
would choose to Do-It-Yourself (*DIY*) your own mail server, and adds
to that collaboration capabilities, mobile phone synchronization,
native integration in to desktop operating system platforms such as Mac
OS X, Linux and Windows -- in a ready-to-go, integrated offering with a
uniquely uniform look and feel.

This is built from the ground up with **security**, **privacy** and
**user control** in mind, reusing the best of Free Software where
already available. As such, Kolab Groupware is unique in that it
is both secure and completely Free Software. Our community motto is
therefore to *"Do it right or not at all"*.
