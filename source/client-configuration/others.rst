Other Clients
=============

As long as your client application is following the standards,
it can be used to connect to |service_name|.
Below is an overview of the various protocols we support
along with the settings you need to enter in your client.

.. index:: IMAP Server
.. _settings-clientconfig-imap-generic:

IMAP Settings
-------------

You can basically connect every standard email application with support for the 
IMAP protocol to |service_name|. Please use the following settings to connect.

*Incoming server (IMAP):*
    |**imap_host**|

*Port/Security:*
    |**imap_port**| + |**imap_ssl**|

*Authentication:*
    **Password**

*Username:*
    |**useremail**|

Please use your **full and primary email address** as username here.

.. only:: tls

    .. note::

        We offer TLS  encryption for the connection to these services and 
        advise  to always use it.


.. only:: dav

    .. index:: CalDAV, CardDAV
    .. _settings-clientconfig-dav-generic:

    CardDAV and CalDAV Settings
    ---------------------------

    Please point your `CalDAV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV>`_ and 
    `CardDAV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV>`_ capable client to these addresses:

    *For CalDAV:*
        |**caldav_uri**|

    or if that did not work:
        |**caldav_uri_long**|

    *For CardDAV:*
        |**carddav_uri**|

    or if that did not work:
        |**carddav_uri_long**|

    When using the alternative address, please make sure to replace the last part (|**username**| and domain) with your actual username
    or switch to a client that is able to auto-discover the correct addresses based on the short address.

.. only:: webdav

    .. index:: WebDAV
    .. _settings-clientconfig-webdav-generic:

    Files
    -----

    The easiest way to access your files is using the web client. In the top 
    right corner, you can just choose 'Files'.

    You can also use any `WebDAV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV#Clients>`_ 
    capable client to get access to your files. 
    Just point it to one of the following locations.

        |**webdav_uri**|

        **webdavs://**\ |**webdav_host**|

        **davs://**\ |**webdav_host**|

    The first should work for most people. Try the others only if the first one 
    does not work for you.

.. only:: activesync

    .. index:: ActiveSync
    .. _settings-clientconfig-activesync-generic:

    ActiveSync
    ----------

    Kolab also supports the proprietary ActiveSync protocol.
    In order to connect your client to |service_name| via this protocol,
    please use the following server address.

        |**activesync_host**|
