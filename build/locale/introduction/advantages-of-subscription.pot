Subscribers, on the other hand, benefit immediately from fixes as they become available between releases.

msgid "This is vitally important for production deployments, as significant changes may occur from one annual release to the next. Performing “update the world” upgrades to production systems every year can be a significant task and induce risk, both of which incur costs. Subscribers, on the other hand, can upgrade when it fits their interests best, secure in the knowledge that the version of Kolab they are currently running will be supported for years to come in that configuration."
