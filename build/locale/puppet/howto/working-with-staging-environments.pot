# 3cf590a6e8ba481b883f6ede3ef5ca97
msgid "When such changes (and their iterations) accumulate, the divergent nature of the development stage makes it harder to appreciate the consequences of applying any changes to the production environment. Furthermore, multiple topics may be in development in parallel, and some may be ready for promotion, while others may not."
