msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:92
msgid "This HOWTO outlines what staging environments are, what you could be using them for, and to what purpose they are implemented in our default Puppet master server configuration, and the Puppet modules we provide."

msgid "Why Stage Environments?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:99
msgid "Like in any development process, whether it be software, infrastructure or the combined article, it is generally beneficial to have one or more pre-production stages in which work can take place, of which the consequences are not necessarily clear."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:104
msgid "For a variety of reasons, the exact structure of you environment's Puppet manifests and classes tends to be under continuous development."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:107
msgid "Typos and syntax errors in Puppet manifests, classes and modules notwithstanding, you will likely want to avoid automatically applying any changes to your production environment -- the risk tends to be it stops making you money or costs you a bunch should it stop functioning."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:112
msgid "Should everything go through rather smoothly, however, then the result of the changes applied is still not necessarily the result actually desired. Multiple iterations of modifications may be required to get the desired state described well enough."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:117
msgid "When such changes (and their iterations) accumulate, the divergent nature of the development stage makes it harder to appreciate the consequences of applying any changes to the production environment. Furthermore, multiple topics may be in development in parallel, and some may be ready for promotion, while others may not."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:123
msgid "Such risky, asynchronous development must converge in a controlled fashion, and verified the upgrade path for, in a stage between development and production -- *testing*, perhaps."
msgstr ""

msgid "Description of Default Environment Stages"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:130
msgid "The modules and usually also the domain's manifests tend to use a source code management repository for revision control, and in our case this is GIT."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:134
msgid "GIT makes it easy to read logs, review commits and merge, cherry-pick or otherwise promote changes."

msgid "**development**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:139
msgid "The development environment stage is intended for free-for-all, lather-rinse-repeat type of environments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:142
msgid "Several of many things are in development, including systems, services, infrastructure topology and applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:145
msgid "Application developers typically have full access to the systems in this stage, software is not necessarily running based on packaged or released versions, packages such as ``git`` and other development utilities are installed, and the update policy might amount to as much as \"apply all of them as soon as they become available\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:151
msgid "As such, the development environment is highly volatile, and because too many people can mess around with it too much, should be completely reproducible fast, cheaply and from scratch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:155
msgid "As such, while monitoring and trending is useful -- for your developers to autonomously recognize the current state, rather than ask you -- but the alerting policy may be different."

msgid "**testing**"

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:165
msgid "For each one of the pending updates to production, and often a combination of multiple pending updates and/or upgrades, one resets the testing environment to the equivalent state of the (then current) production environment, and attempt to complete the update successfully."

msgid "**production**"

msgid "The following diagram depicts the workflow for a System Administrator to apply changes, have the changes applied to each environment, and be provided with the required feedback on its success or failure."

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:230
msgid "A system administrator commits a change to git, and pushes the changes back."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:235
msgid "Note that a commit happens on a branch, and your branches could be named *development*, *testing* and *production*, or you could have multiple *remotes* to differentiate write- and/or read- access authorization. Furthmore, you could put review utilities and continued integration facilities in."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:241
msgid "The Puppet server is itself managed by Puppet, and fetches new revisions of the configured git repositories during every run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:244
msgid "The run interval is normally 30 minutes, so it may take up to 30 minutes before the change is at all available to the Puppet master itself, and up to another 30 minutes before the changes are applied to relevant Puppet clients."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:249
msgid "The *development* environment is configured to apply all changes automatically, except for resources that have specifically been supplied a ``noop => true`` meta-parameter -- this is Puppet-speak."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:253
msgid "The *testing* environment still applies configuration changes automatically, and is supposed to be treated as such, in that it retains a state somewhat comparable to current production and few steps beyond that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:258
msgid "The *production* environment does **not** apply **any** change automatically, except for resources that have specifically been supplied a ``noop => false`` meta-parameter -- again, Puppet speak."
