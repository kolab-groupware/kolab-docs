msgid "Like in any development process, whether it be software, infrastructure or the combined article, it is generally beneficial to have one or more pre-production stages in which work can take place, of which the consequences are not necessarily clear."

msgid "Should everything go through rather smoothly, however, then the result of the changes applied is still not necessarily the result actually desired. Multiple iterations of modifications may be required to get the desired state described well enough."

# e0b8e97f65ed4d9e98d27045feecb052
msgid "When such changes (and their iterations) accumulate, the divergent nature of the development stage makes it harder to appreciate the consequences of applying any changes to the production environment. Furthermore, multiple topics may be in development in parallel, and some may be ready for promotion, while others may not."
