msgid "Like in any development process, whether it be software, infrastructure or the combined article, it is generally beneficial to have one or more pre-production stages in which work can take place, of which the consequences are not necessarily clear."

msgid "Typos and syntax errors in Puppet manifests, classes and modules notwithstanding, you will likely want to avoid automatically applying any changes to your production environment -- the risk tends to be it stops making you money or costs you a bunch should it stop functioning."

msgid "Should everything go through rather smoothly, however, then the result of the changes applied is still not necessarily the result actually desired. Multiple iterations of modifications may be required to get the desired state described well enough."

# 92328b4bb0d241bbb530fc0805495b35
msgid "When such changes (and their iterations) accumulate, the divergent nature of the development stage makes it harder to appreciate the consequences of applying any changes to the production environment. Furthermore, multiple topics may be in development in parallel, and some may be ready for promotion, while others may not."
