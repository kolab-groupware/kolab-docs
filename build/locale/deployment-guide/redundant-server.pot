msgid "Using DRBD"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/redundant-server.rst:109
msgid "When used solely for redundancy, `DRBD`_ replicates the disk of a single node to another node, implying the replica master is the active server, while the slave remains passive. That is to say, that the replica master **can**, while the replica slave **can not** access the data on the replicated volume."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/redundant-server.rst:140
msgid "In this scenario, the master is the active server running all Kolab servers, while the slave is completely passive (it cannot write to the disk being replicated). A failover would ensure the master is not running any longer, and start the services on the slave -- which therefore becomes the master."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/redundant-server.rst:146
msgid "In a more complex scenario, two separate volumes could be replicated in an cross-link scenario, allowing the resources of both nodes to be used in parallel, establishing a limited form of load-balancing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/redundant-server.rst:184
msgid "Using DRBD in a so-called *dual-primary* mode requires the use of a *shared filesystem* such as *Global File System* (GFS, not to be confused with GlusterFS)."
