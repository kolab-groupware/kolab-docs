# a9687a9c1a164a23af279dd02a4f211a
msgid "When used solely for redundancy, `DRBD`_ replicates the disk of a single node to another node, implying the replica master is the active server, while the slave remains passive. That is to say, that the replica master **can**, while the replica slave **can not** access the data on the replicated volume."
msgstr ""

# d296743a6f854f04ae508fbe3aa281ad
msgid "In this scenario, the master is the active server running all Kolab servers, while the slave is completely passive (it cannot write to the disk being replicated). A failover would ensure the master is not running any longer, and start the services on the slave -- which therefore becomes the master."

msgid "In a more complex scenario, two separate volumes could be replicated in an cross-link scenario, allowing the resources of both nodes to be used in parallel, establishing a limited form of load-balancing."
