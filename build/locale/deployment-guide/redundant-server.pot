# baf4eb63b33f4aed8b6a7e6e3ac75704
msgid "When used solely for redundancy, `DRBD`_ replicates the disk of a single node to another node, implying the replica master is the active server, while the slave remains passive. That is to say, that the replica master **can**, while the replica slave **can not** access the data on the replicated volume."

msgid "In this scenario, the master is the active server running all Kolab servers, while the slave is completely passive (it cannot write to the disk being replicated). A failover would ensure the master is not running any longer, and start the services on the slave -- which therefore becomes the master."

msgid "In a more complex scenario, two separate volumes could be replicated in an cross-link scenario, allowing the resources of both nodes to be used in parallel, establishing a limited form of load-balancing."
