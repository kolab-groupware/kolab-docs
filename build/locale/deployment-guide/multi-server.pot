#: ../../source/deployment-guide/multi-server.rst:708
msgid "A single web server can not handle the requests of too many users, and even if it could, it would not be high-available. When web services are distributed, especially where it concerns a single web application being distributed, things such as sessions and also some caches must be stored outside the web server node."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/multi-server.rst:714
msgid "This is to prevent a loss of session validity when users turn (out) to hit another web server node for subsequent requests as part of their existing session, and should be taken in to account even when \"sticky\" load-balancing is employed."

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/multi-server.rst:719

msgid "You could simply use memcached for the session storage, but this moves the single point of failure just one step further -- namely should the memcached server, fail, sessions are lost."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/multi-server.rst:730
msgid "To reduce the number of sessions lost, or to increase storage capacity horizontally, one can supply multiple memcached servers to the session storage driver, which will be used as a pool -- the sessions would be spread throughout the pool. Loss of a single memcached server is then limits to only a subset of the sessions."
