msgid "Drupal is one of many web applications that comes in a tarball you extract the contents of, and you typically dump those contents inside the directory hierarchy of a document root. As such, Drupal is a good **example** to get started with, examining what exactly is put in to the document root (and would therefore be considered \"published\"), what information is in these files, who has access to them, why this could be considered bad, how to protect the deployment of such an application, and how to develop web applications in such a way that the level of protection on a server-side configuration level may not need to be as complex."
