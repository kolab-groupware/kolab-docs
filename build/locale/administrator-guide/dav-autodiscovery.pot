So when configuring a CalDAV client for the account ``sample@example.org``, the client will take the domain part of the account name and send a HTTP(S) request to ``https://example.org/.well-known/caldav`` which is expected to redirect to the service URL using a HTTP mechanisms, e.g. with a *301 Moved Permanently* response."
