msgid "The principle of storing a shared secret at any one location -- let alone at multiple individual, stand-alone locations -- that also harbors the attack surface of a service is a virtual no-go. Storing the shared secret in plaintext is one type of offence, and storing the shared secret in a reverse-cryptable fashion is another type of offence."

msgid "However, some networks may have, in the past, some long time ago, consciously or otherwise, decided that running a PKI was just slightly too inconvenient, and perhaps unprotected traffic would therefore need not exchange any user's credentials in humanly legible form. Enter secrecy for the wire, but obscurity for the client and the server both."

msgid "To migrate such environments, one might enable CRAM-MD5 and/or DIGEST-MD5 authentication credential exchange mechanisms. The assumption is that either you use :file:`/etc/sasldb2` and have the means to synchronize password changes over however many systems, or that you already use a plugin allowing you to centralize the storage so it can be reached by multiple systems, over the network. Re-apply whichever logic to your Kolab servers, and you should be fine and live happily ever after -- you get rid of plain text copies of users' passwords on your servers."
