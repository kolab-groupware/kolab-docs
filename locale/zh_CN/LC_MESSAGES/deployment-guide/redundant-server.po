msgid ""
"When used solely for redundancy, `DRBD`_ replicates the disk of a single "
"node to another node, implying the replica master is the active server, "
"while the slave remains passive. That is to say, that the replica master "
"**can**, while the replica slave **can not** access the data on the "
"replicated volume."

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/redundant-server.rst:94
msgid ""
"In this scenario, the master is the active server running all Kolab servers, "
"while the slave is completely passive (it cannot write to the disk being "
"replicated). A failover would ensure the master is not running any longer, "
"and start the services on the slave -- which therefore becomes the master."

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/redundant-server.rst:100
msgid ""
"In a more complex scenario, two separate volumes could be replicated in an "
"cross-link scenario, allowing the resources of both nodes to be used in "
"parallel, establishing a limited form of load-balancing."

"Using DRBD in a so-called *dual-primary* mode requires the use of a *shared "
