"These two credential exchange mechanisms depend on the tip of the iceberg"
" being a shared secret, that both parties have available to them in "
"plaintext, prior to the actual exchange of credentials."

"Starting at such tip, the mechanisms basically describe a methodology for"
" the server and the client to each end up with an iceberg of the same "
"dimensions, so that it can be compared, and matched."

"The principle of storing a shared secret at any one location -- let alone"
" at multiple individual, stand-alone locations -- that also harbors the "
"attack surface of a service is a virtual no-go. Storing the shared secret"
" in plaintext is one type of offence, and storing the shared secret in a "
"reverse-cryptable fashion is another type of offence."

"However, some networks may have, in the past, some long time ago, "
"consciously or otherwise, decided that running a PKI was just slightly "
"too inconvenient, and perhaps unprotected traffic would therefore need "
"not exchange any user's credentials in humanly legible form. Enter "
"secrecy for the wire, but obscurity for the client and the server both."

"To migrate such environments, one might enable CRAM-MD5 and/or DIGEST-MD5"
" authentication credential exchange mechanisms. The assumption is that "
"either you use :file:`/etc/sasldb2` and have the means to synchronize "
"password changes over however many systems, or that you already use a "
"plugin allowing you to centralize the storage so it can be reached by "
"multiple systems, over the network. Re-apply whichever logic to your "
"Kolab servers, and you should be fine and live happily ever after -- you "
"get rid of plain text copies of users' passwords on your servers."
