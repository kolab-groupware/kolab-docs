"A *standard* Kolab Groupware deployment also supports :term:`alias domain"
" name spaces`, meaning that a setup for a domain name space of "

"This is to say that an organization such as **Business, Inc.** with a "

"A hosted Kolab Groupware deployment is very similar to a *multi-domain* "

"Allowing customers to create accounts brings with it a set of additional "

"required to request."

"Furthermore, for customers that register a domain name space, you'll need"
