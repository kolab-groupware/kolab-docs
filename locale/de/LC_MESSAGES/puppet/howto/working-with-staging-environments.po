"Like in any development process, whether it be software, infrastructure or "
"the combined article, it is generally beneficial to have one or more pre-"
"production stages in which work can take place, of which the consequences "
"are not necessarily clear."

"Typos and syntax errors in Puppet manifests, classes and modules "
"notwithstanding, you will likely want to avoid automatically applying any "
"changes to your production environment -- the risk tends to be it stops "
"making you money or costs you a bunch should it stop functioning."

"Should everything go through rather smoothly, however, then the result of "
"the changes applied is still not necessarily the result actually desired. "
"Multiple iterations of modifications may be required to get the desired "
"state described well enough."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/puppet/howto/working-with-staging-environments.rst:71
msgid ""
"When such changes (and their iterations) accumulate, the divergent nature of "
"the development stage makes it harder to appreciate the consequences of "
"applying any changes to the production environment. Furthermore, multiple "
"topics may be in development in parallel, and some may be ready for "
"promotion, while others may not."
