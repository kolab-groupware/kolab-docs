"`Seafile <http://seafile.com>`_ is GPL v3-licensed software designed to host "
"files privately and securely on the Web, in a similar fashion as some "
"popular proprietary solutions. As of Kolab version 3.4, Chwala (the file "
"storage component of Kolab) can use Seafile as a backend to store files."
