"A single web server can not handle the requests of too many users, and even "

"distributed, especially where it concerns a single web application being "
"distributed, things such as sessions and also some caches must be stored "
"outside the web server node."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/multi-server.rst:668
msgid ""
"This is to prevent a loss of session validity when users turn (out) to hit "
"another web server node for subsequent requests as part of their existing "
"session, and should be taken in to account even when \"sticky\" load-"
"balancing is employed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/multi-server.rst:673
msgid ""
"Since this session storage must be available to all web server nodes "

"You could simply use memcached for the session storage, but this moves the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment-guide/multi-server.rst:684
msgid ""
"To reduce the number of sessions lost, or to increase storage capacity "
"horizontally, one can supply multiple memcached servers to the session "
