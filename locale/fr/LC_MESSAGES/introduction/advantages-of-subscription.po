"Subscription-based support is available for Kolab from `Kolab Systems AG`_. "
"Kolab Systems is the primary developer and maintainer of Kolab, and provides "
"enterprise-level design, deployment, development, and support for Kolab "
"installations to public and private organizations of all sizes. "
"Subscriptions are offered on a per-seat basis, and provide subscribers with "
"distinct advantages."

"Subscriptions are an excellent way to support the ongoing development of "
"Kolab, as proceeds go directly into infrastructure Kolab development relies "
"on as well as the employment of the core Kolab technical team."

"But the most compelling aspect of subscriptions are the exclusive benefits "
"that come with them. These advantages reliably lower the cost of ownership "

"Non-subscribers will need to update their Kolab installations annually to "
"get the last year's worth of fixes and improvements. Subscribers, on the "
"other hand, benefit immediately from fixes as they become available between "
"releases. Along with releases, all updates are cryptographically signed with "
"Kolab System's private GPG key allowing verification of the binaries."

"This is vitally important for production deployments, as significant changes "
"may occur from one annual release to the next. Performing “update the world” "
"upgrades to production systems every year can be a significant task and "
"induce risk, both of which incur costs. Subscribers, on the other hand, can "
"upgrade when it fits their interests best, secure in the knowledge that the "
"version of Kolab they are currently running will be supported for years to "
"come in that configuration."

"And of course, all released packages are kept in perpetuity, which grants "

"Kolab Systems' “Tiger Team” of specialists may be retained by those with "

"(e.g. with existing directory services, including Active Directory), custom "
