"Well-known URIs are used when setting up CalDAV and CardDAV clients to "
"automatically detect the service configuration, mainly the server URI. So "
"when configuring a CalDAV client for the account ``sample@example.org``, the "
"client will take the domain part of the account name and send a HTTP(S) "
"request to ``https://example.org/.well-known/caldav`` which is expected to "
"redirect to the service URL using a HTTP mechanisms, e.g. with a *301 Moved "
"Permanently* response."
