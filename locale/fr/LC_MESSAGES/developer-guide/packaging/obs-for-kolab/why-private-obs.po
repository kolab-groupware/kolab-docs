"One of the most frequently asked questions, even before we ever started "
"implementing the use of OBS, is why we would run a private instance."

"In the public OBS, the release management aspects of a *3.0 stable release* "
"versus a *3.1 development release* are reflected poorly, if at all, and the "
"projects related to the OBS projects are **out of mainstream** [#]_, and "
"have not yet been submitted back upstream."

"Kolab Groupware requires the updates released for a certain platform to be "

"Kolab Groupware holds a natural need for 3rd party or additional software "

"For Enterprise Linux 6, we require `Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux "
"<http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_ by the Fedora Project, for Ubuntu we "
"require packages from it's *universe* software repository, and for openSUSE "
"we require packages from a third party repository such as `server:php:"

"Kolab Systems heavily relies on the expertise of its in-house packagers, all "

"inclusion of the packaging work into upstream distributions, certain "

"be met across distributions."

"We therefore have Enterprise Linux 6 as our current reference platform for a "

"for Kolab Groupware in general, to reflect the Enterprise Linux build system "
